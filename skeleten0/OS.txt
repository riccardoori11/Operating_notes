Skeleton0++: Operating System (OS)

[Input Layer]
→ Binary instruction streams
→ Hardware resources (CPU, memory, disk, I/O, network)
→ User/system-level requests (program launches, I/O operations, syscalls)
→ Interrupts and hardware signals
→ Configuration data (bootloader, kernel params)

[Core Mechanism Layer]

1. Bootstrapping & Kernel Initialization
→ BIOS/UEFI loads bootloader (e.g., GRUB)
→ Bootloader loads OS kernel into memory
→ Kernel initializes memory maps, devices, scheduler, process tables

2. Memory Management
→ Virtual memory abstraction
→ Paging and segmentation
→ Page tables, TLBs, MMU interaction
→ Swapping, memory-mapped files, copy-on-write

3. Process and Thread Management
→ Process creation (fork/exec), destruction (exit)
→ Context switching and CPU scheduling (round robin, CFS, priority queues)
→ Thread abstraction, user vs kernel threads
→ IPC (pipes, sockets, shared memory, message queues)

4. System Calls and Privilege Separation
→ User–kernel mode separation
→ Syscall interrupt/trap gate
→ Kernel syscall dispatch table
→ Return to user space with result

5. File System and Storage
→ File abstraction (inode, directory entries, vnodes)
→ Block vs character devices
→ Filesystem mounting (ext4, NTFS, FAT32)
→ Journaling, caching, lazy writes

6. I/O Management
→ Polling vs interrupts
→ DMA (direct memory access)
→ Device drivers and hardware abstraction layer
→ Buffering, queuing, I/O scheduling

7. Scheduling and Concurrency
→ Process state machine (ready, running, waiting)
→ Preemption and time-slicing
→ Mutexes, semaphores, condition variables
→ Deadlock, starvation, priority inversion

8. Networking Stack
→ Socket API (Berkeley sockets)
→ Protocol stack: NIC → Driver → IP → TCP/UDP → User space
→ Packet routing, NAT, ARP, DNS
→ Zero-copy and interrupt coalescing

9. Security and Access Control
→ User/group IDs, permissions (chmod/chown)
→ Capabilities, DAC vs MAC (SELinux, AppArmor)
→ Sandboxing, chroot, namespaces, containers

10. Virtualization and Isolation
→ Hypervisor (Type 1/Type 2)
→ Paravirtualization vs full virtualization
→ Containerization (namespaces + cgroups)
→ Emulation vs virtualization

11. Power and Resource Management
→ CPU frequency scaling, idle states
→ Battery-aware scheduling
→ Kernel tick vs tickless
→ Resource accounting (quotas, limits, nice values)

12. Debugging and Introspection
→ dmesg, strace, gdb, perf, sysctl
→ Kernel crash dumps (kdump, core files)
→ Logging daemons (syslog, journald)

[Output Layer]
→ Reliable execution of user programs
→ Managed sharing of finite hardware
→ Isolation and protection
→ System responsiveness and stability
→ Transparent abstraction of low-level operations

[Failure Modes / Pathologies]
→ Race conditions, deadlocks, kernel panics
→ Memory leaks, fragmentation
→ Privilege escalation, buffer overflows
→ Scheduler starvation, thrashing
→ I/O bottlenecks, file system corruption

[Feedback Loops]
→ Kernel adjusts scheduler based on load
→ Memory pressure triggers paging/swapping
→ Hardware interrupts trigger context switches
→ Usage metrics influence power/resource allocation

[Summary Flow]
BIOS → bootloader → kernel → memory/process/filesystem/I/O init → syscall entrypoints → multitasking, resource allocation, and user I/O → OS mediates all hardware access and execution under protection, isolation, and abstraction guarantees.
