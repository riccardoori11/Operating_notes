 skeleten0 of a fork:

 input: a call of fork() in a process, kernel which supports memory management
 and process table

 mechanisms:

 fork is invoked by user -> new entry in process table + memory cow -> file
 descriptor duplication -> return value split -> two processes resume from
 same instruction

 output:
 two nearly identical processes running concurrently, they may diverge if
 parent calls wait() or child calls exec()
