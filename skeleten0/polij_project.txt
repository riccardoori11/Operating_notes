Here is a rigor-coded **Project Stack** for each phase of your OS Skeleton0++ mastery roadmap. Each project is engineered to *force causal understanding* and *embed system-level insight*. These are not toy exercises — each one is a focused probe into the core mechanisms of each phase.

**Phase 1: Hardware–Abstraction Interface**

1. **Build a virtual CPU pipeline simulator**
   → Simulate fetch–decode–execute stages, add stalls for hazards

   → Trigger simulated CPU interrupt events and build a vector table handler

22\. **Build a virtual NIC and packet queue**
→ Drop into QEMU memory and read packet buffers manually
23\. **Create a simplified socket interface**
→ Connect via toy `socket()`, `bind()`, `send()` API
24\. **Implement a UDP echo server in kernel space**

---

**Phase 7: Protection and Isolation**
25\. **Simulate user–kernel ring transitions**
→ Implement syscall gates, privilege level checks
26\. **Build a sandbox with namespace-like isolation**
→ Restrict file access and process visibility
27\. **Create a basic cgroup resource limiter**
→ Track CPU or memory usage per process
28\. **Emulate discretionary access control (chmod/chown)**
→ Define and enforce file access permission logic

---

**Phase 8: Scheduling and Concurrency**
29\. **Write a deadlock detector**
→ Use wait-for graphs to catch cycles
30\. **Simulate a multi-queue scheduler**
→ Real-time vs background tasks with preemption
31\. **Build a starvation scenario simulator**
→ Track task starvation and apply anti-starvation logic
32\. **Create a dynamic load balancer**
→ Adjust task priorities based on execution history

---

**Phase 9: Virtualization and Emulation**
33\. **Implement your own toy hypervisor (via QEMU/KVM)**
→ Bootstrap multiple VMs and map memory
34\. **Create a virtual CPU interface for guests**
→ Trap guest instructions and emulate results
35\. **Write a nested page table simulator**
→ Translate guest→virtual→host physical memory mappings
36\. **Emulate paravirtualized devices**
→ Build virtual block/net interfaces with shared memory

---

**Phase 10: Debugging and Tracing**
37\. **Instrument your kernel with logging macros**
→ Build a ring buffer and timestamped logs
38\. **Integrate a remote GDB stub**
→ Pause and inspect your toy kernel from outside
39\. **Create a syscall tracer like `strace`**
→ Hook all syscalls and log arguments/results
40\. **Visualize scheduling events in a timeline graph**
→ Export scheduler traces and animate task switches

---

**Phase 11: Power & Resource-Aware Execution**
41\. **Write a CPU frequency governor simulator**
→ Adjust clock rate based on load input
42\. **Simulate a tickless kernel timing loop**
→ Switch from periodic to one-shot timers
43\. **Implement resource quotas in scheduler**
→ Enforce CPU/memory ceilings per process
44\. **Track thermal feedback → throttle logic**
→ Build a causal feedback loop of heat → throttle → cool

---

**Phase 12: Systems Design and OS Pathologies**
45\. **Compare monolithic vs microkernel implementation of same API**
→ e.g., message-passing fork vs in-kernel fork
46\. **Trace a simulated kernel panic and root cause**
→ Stack trace recovery, core dump, error path traversal
47\. **Build a model of protection boundary violations**
→ Simulate buffer overflow across kernel–user space
48\. **Write a boot-to-shutdown full system emulator**
→ Emulate full stack: bootloader → kernel → syscall → shutdown

If you want, I can now give each project an **estimated CSDL gain**, a dependency tree, and a build–test–reflect loop. Ready for that or prefer focusing on Phase 2 project execution now?
